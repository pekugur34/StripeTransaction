```

## Requirements

- .NET Core 3.1 or later (.NET Core 3.1, .NET 5, .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET 8)
- Stripe.net 41.0.0 or later

## Quick Start

```csharp
// Initialize with your Stripe API key
StripeTransactionConfiguration.Initialize("your_stripe_api_key");

// Use the transaction
using (var transaction = new StripeTransaction())
{
    // Create a customer
    var customer = await transaction.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
    {
        var customerService = new CustomerService();
        return await customerService.CreateAsync(new CustomerCreateOptions
        {
            Email = "customer@example.com",
            Name = "John Doe"
        });
    });

    // Add a payment method
    var paymentMethod = await transaction.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
    {
        var paymentMethodService = new PaymentMethodService();
        return await paymentMethodService.CreateAsync(new PaymentMethodCreateOptions
        {
            Type = "card",
            Card = new PaymentMethodCardOptions
            {
                Number = "4242424242424242",
                ExpMonth = 12,
                ExpYear = 2024,
                Cvc = "123"
            }
        });
    });
}
```

### Multiple Operations in a Single Transaction

You can also execute multiple operations in a single `ExecuteAsync` call:

```csharp
using (var transaction = new StripeTransaction())
{
    // Create a customer and attach a payment method in one transaction
    var (customer, paymentMethod) = await transaction.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
    {
        // Create customer
        var customerService = new CustomerService();
        var customer = await customerService.CreateAsync(new CustomerCreateOptions
        {
            Email = "customer@example.com",
            Name = "John Doe"
        });

        // Create payment method
        var paymentMethodService = new PaymentMethodService();
        var paymentMethod = await paymentMethodService.CreateAsync(new PaymentMethodCreateOptions
        {
            Type = "card",
            Card = new PaymentMethodCardOptions
            {
                Number = "4242424242424242",
                ExpMonth = 12,
                ExpYear = 2024,
                Cvc = "123"
            }
        });

        // Attach payment method to customer
        await paymentMethodService.AttachAsync(paymentMethod.Id, new PaymentMethodAttachOptions
        {
            Customer = customer.Id
        });

        // Return both objects
        return (customer, paymentMethod);
    });

    // Use the customer and payment method
    Console.WriteLine($"Created customer: {customer.Id}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Attached payment method: {paymentMethod.Id}");
}
```

### Complex Transaction Example

Here's an example of a more complex transaction with multiple operations:

```csharp
using (var transaction = new StripeTransaction())
{
    var (customer, subscription, paymentIntent) = await transaction.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
    {
        // 1. Create customer
        var customerService = new CustomerService();
        var customer = await customerService.CreateAsync(new CustomerCreateOptions
        {
            Email = "customer@example.com",
            Name = "John Doe"
        });

        // 2. Create and attach payment method
        var paymentMethodService = new PaymentMethodService();
        var paymentMethod = await paymentMethodService.CreateAsync(new PaymentMethodCreateOptions
        {
            Type = "card",
            Card = new PaymentMethodCardOptions
            {
                Number = "4242424242424242",
                ExpMonth = 12,
                ExpYear = 2024,
                Cvc = "123"
            }
        });
        await paymentMethodService.AttachAsync(paymentMethod.Id, new PaymentMethodAttachOptions
        {
            Customer = customer.Id
        });

        // 3. Create subscription
        var subscriptionService = new SubscriptionService();
        var subscription = await subscriptionService.CreateAsync(new SubscriptionCreateOptions
        {
            Customer = customer.Id,
            Items = new List<SubscriptionItemOptions>
            {
                new SubscriptionItemOptions
                {
                    Price = "price_H5ggYwtDq4fbrJ"
                }
            }
        });

        // 4. Create payment intent
        var paymentIntentService = new PaymentIntentService();
        var paymentIntent = await paymentIntentService.CreateAsync(new PaymentIntentCreateOptions
        {
            Amount = 2000,
            Currency = "usd",
            Customer = customer.Id,
            PaymentMethod = paymentMethod.Id,
            Confirm = true
        });

        // Return all created objects
        return (customer, subscription, paymentIntent);
    });

    // Use the created objects
    Console.WriteLine($"Created customer: {customer.Id}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Created subscription: {subscription.Id}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Created payment intent: {paymentIntent.Id}");
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Logging

The library supports custom logging through the `IStripeTransactionLogger` interface:

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package StripeTransaction
```

## Requirements

- .NET Core 3.1 or later (.NET Core 3.1, .NET 5, .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET 8)
- Stripe.net 41.0.0 or later

### Error Handling

The library automatically handles errors and performs rollbacks when operations fail:

```csharp
try
{
    using (var transaction = new StripeTransaction())
    {
        // Your transaction code
    }
}
catch (StripeException ex)
{
    // Handle Stripe-specific errors
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle other errors
}
```

### Supported Operations

The library supports rollback for the following Stripe operations:

- Customer creation/deletion
- Payment method attachment/detachment
- Subscription creation/cancellation
- Webhook endpoint creation/deletion
- Payment intent creation/cancellation
- Invoice creation/voiding

## Best Practices

1. Always initialize the library with your Stripe API key at application startup
2. Use the `using` statement to ensure proper disposal and rollback
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use custom logging for better debugging
5. Test your rollback scenarios thoroughly
6. Group related operations in a single `ExecuteAsync` call for better atomicity
